# YourNews - A News Application created with Django

This is my Django news application that uses bootstrap for a simple, clean user interface and includes a navbar for easy navigation between templates for all users.

## Admins - Important

Roles are assigned by django admin users or superusers. All users who register on the app first become readers. Readers can apply for a role via the navbar button. Once applied, an admin will need to review the application and if changed to 'approved' status, their role will change and the reader will lose their subscriptions (if any), while gaining new permissions and functions based on their new role. If the user's new role is a journalist or editor, the admin will also need to assign them to a Publisher.

## User functionality and permissions

- Readers: Can view approved articles, newsletters (don't need approval), and subscribe to journalists or publishers.
- Journalists: Full CRUD functionality for their articles and newsletters. Linked to a publisher by an admin upon role change.
- Editors: Are also linked to a publisher by an admin upon role change. They are responsible for approving or rejecting articles. Can view all articles and newsletters. They can edit and delete articles and newsletters from their Publisher only.
- Publishers: They have permissions to edit, view and delete articles/newsletters, but their webapp options are currently limited to only viewing. Their unique function is viewing their editors, journalists and other related stats such as subscriptions from their dashboard.
- Admins can currently have any role as normal in addition to being an admin. This makes testing easier, but can be modified for production.

## Quick Setup instructions for the web app

- Check that you are using the desired database settings in settings.py (default should be sqlite3 already for development purposes).
- Create and activate a virtual environment (venv)
- Then install the dependencies from the included requirements.txt file. For my full requirements file (including dev tools), see requirements-dev.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Apply database migrations.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- Create a Superuser in order to approve applications of users so that they can acquire new roles.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Follow the prompts
- Once this is done, you can run the server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

- Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000
- You can now register users and apply for roles
- With your admin/superuser, you can log into the news app and navigate to your Admin Dashboard from the Navbar.
- Here you can approve user applications and select a Publisher for them in the case of an Editor or Journalist.

## Emails

Emails are currently set up as file based for testing. They are sent following these actions:

- A user is approved or rejected for an applied role
- Readers are emailed articles (once approved) or newsletters (once submitted) if they are subscribed to the author (journalist) or corresponding publisher.
- Journalists are notified when their articles are approved and sent or when newsletters are sent out to subscribers successfully.
- Users request a password reset.

Formatters used:

- Python: Black
- django-html: Djlint

## API and Testing
